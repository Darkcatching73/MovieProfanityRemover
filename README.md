# HDMIClosedCaptioningFilter

The HDMI Closed Captioning Filter is a Python program that runs on a Raspberry Pi and allows you to filter out swear words from closed captioning tracks in movies and TV shows. The program uses the OpenCV library to parse HDMI input, detects the name of the movie or TV show, pulls the closed captioning track from the internet, searches for swear words, and removes them from the closed captioning track.
